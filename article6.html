							<h3>Candu Calandria Reactors</h3>
							<div class="paragraph">
								<p>CANDU Reactors are Canadian designed heavy water reactors. CANDU Reactors are fueled by natural uranium and utilize heavy water, also known as deuterium as it's moderator and coolant. The natural uranium is converted into fuel pellets and heat is generated by splitting these uranium atoms in a process called nuclear fission. This reaction releases heat into the moderator. The heated heavy water is then moved to steam generators where the heat is transferred to regular water and converted into pressurized steam.The pressurized steam then pushes the turbines blades and causes the roter to spin. The roter is a large magnet producing magnetic fields which move across copper wires and produce electricity.  CANDU Reactors are comprised of multiple important components such as fuel channels, endshields, and safety systems. The following video goes into more detail on CANDU reactor components and their functions. Watch this video to help answer the quiz questions.</p>

						<h3>Virtual Reality Model of a CANDU Reactor</h3>
						<div class="paragraph">
							<p>This video showcases our VR model of the CANDU Calandria.The VR environment is comprised of a full-scale model of a CANDU reactor and a variety of simulations to demonstrate its functionality. This project incorporates innovative virtual reality technologies to the nuclear field to modernize the education and training process regarding CANDU reactors. A remotely accessible VR model and simulations of the CANDU nuclear reactor for online teaching and training provides an interactive, and immersive full-scale 3D model of a CANDU reactor. The VR environment of the 3D CANDU reactor allows users to walk-through and explore its mechanisms and functions.</p>
